# The Investment Project
This solution performs data analysis on the provided information by using Real-Time Intelligence on Microsoft Fabric, in addition to integrating data from various sources, while making real-time decisions a reality.  
**This project is part of my Fabric and AI Hackathon that can be found here:*

## Inspiration
I drew inspiration for this project/solution from real problems in the banking sector (e.g. Corporate & Investment banking), and from my latest applied skills.

## How to Build/Test
By using Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence, a solution/workload that's completely capable of streaming data to Fabric, driving decisions in real-time, etc.  
**TODO**: Describe/show your code and how you can build this project to test it.

## What it does
- Performs data analysis of the information into Fabric Real-Time Intelligence;  
- Integrates data from various sources;  
- All of this while making real-time decisions a reality`¹`.

`¹Based on the integrated data`

## Challenges I ran into
The transformation/real-time data processing, directly before the streaming data routing.

## What I learned
How to perform a deep analysis with KQL (Kusto Query Language), an effective tool to explore data, identify anomalies, discover patterns and more.

# Inspiration
I drew inspiration for this project/solution from real problems in the banking sector (e.g. Corporate & Investment banking), and from my latest applied skills.

# How to Build/Execute
By using Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence, a solution/workload that's completely capable of streaming data to Fabric, driving decisions in real-time, etc.  
**TODO**: Describe and show your code and how to run this project.

# What it does
- Performs data analysis of the information into Fabric Real-Time Intelligence;  
- Integrates data from various sources;  
- All of this while making real-time decisions a reality`¹`.

`¹Based on the integrated data`

# Challenges I ran into
The transformation/real-time data processing, directly before the streaming data routing.

# What I learned
How to perform a deep analysis with KQL (Kusto Query Language), an effective tool to explore data, identify anomalies, discover patterns and more.
